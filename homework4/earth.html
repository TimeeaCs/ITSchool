                <p>
                    Modern global warming is the result of an increase in magnitude of the so-called greenhouse effect, a warming of 
                    Earth's surface and lower atmosphere caused by the presence of water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxides, 
                    and other greenhouse gases.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Increased heat, drought and insect outbreaks, all linked to climate change, have increased wildfires. 
                    Declining water supplies, reduced agricultural yields, health impacts in cities due to heat, and flooding 
                    and erosion in coastal areas are additional concerns.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Extreme weather events like bushfires, cyclones, droughts and floods are becoming more frequent and more intense as a result of global warming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Changes to rainfall patterns, increasingly severe drought, more frequent heat waves, flooding and extreme weather make it more difficult for farmers to graze livestock and grow produce, 
                    reducing food availability and making it more expensive to buy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One in six species is at risk of extinction because of climate change. To survive, plants, animals and birds confronted with climate change have two options: move or adapt.
                     With the speed of climate change we are experiencing already, itâ€™s often not possible for a species to adapt quickly enough to keep up with
                      its changing environment. And with the amount of habitat destruction, moving is becoming increasingly difficult.
